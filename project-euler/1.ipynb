    "# Project Euler\n",
    "This document contains my solutions to the first 100 [Project Euler](\"https://projecteuler.net/about\") problems. They are all coded in Python3, without any modules, and took less than one minute to run on my computer. I tried to never use any hypothesis that I wasn't sure about, but I didn't always succeed. I tried to keep my code understandable and to add explanations when it relies on some non-trivial math, but it may not be sufficient to understand everything.\n",
