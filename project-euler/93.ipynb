    "> By using each of the digits from the set, $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations ($+, -, \\times, /$) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.\n",
    "    <p>For example,</p>$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "    8 &= (4 \\times (1 + 3)) / 2\\\\\n",
    "    14 &= 4 \\times (3 + 1 / 2)\\\\\n",
    "    19 &= 4 \\times (2 + 3) - 1\\\\\n",
    "    36 &= 3 \\times 4 \\times (2 + 1)\n",
    "    \\end{align}$$\n",
    "    <p>Note that concatenations of the digits, like $12 + 34$, are not allowed.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Using the set, $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which $36$ is the maximum, and each of the numbers $1$ to $28$ can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Find the set of four distinct digits, $a \\lt b \\lt c \\lt d$, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, $1$ to $n$, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: <i>abcd</i>.</p>\n",
