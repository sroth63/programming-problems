This folder contains my solutions to the first 100 problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). They are all coded in Python without modules. I tried to avoid using hypotheses I wasn't sure about, and detailing my thought process.

I have also solved a few more problems, but I'm not allowed to share them publicly.
